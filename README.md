# PDneuralfingerprinting

All codes asscoiated with the XXXXXXXXX publication. Contains codes to i) perform fingerpritning analyses, ii) compute relative contribution of fingerpritning features (i.e., ICC analysis) iii) run regression and decoding analyses iv) plot results 

Overvire of fingerpritning pipeline:


Code is organized in such a way that all the fingerpritning and ICC analyses are done within the pythin environment and saved to a csv

This is then used in R to run additional analyses (e.g., relate the spatial distribution of ICC features to maps obtained from the neuromaps toolbox).

See XXXXX for details.
