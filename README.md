Code associated with the with the XXXXXXXXX publication.

# Information

Contains codes to i) perform fingerprinting analyses, ii) compute relative contribution of fingerprinting features (i.e., ICC analysis) iii) run regression and decoding analyses iv) plot results 

# Methods

Overview of fingerprinting pipeline:

Code is organized in such a way that all the fingerprinting and ICC analyses are done within the python environment and saved to a csv

This is then used in R to run additional analyses (e.g., relate the spatial distribution of ICC features to maps obtained from the neuromaps toolbox--see python code for annotionas).

Preporcessing of the MEG data for the Prevent-AD and PD sample was for another project (see [GitHub](https://github.com/aiwiesman/QPN_Slowing) and [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008223001399) for details)
