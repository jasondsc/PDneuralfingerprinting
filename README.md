# PDneuralfingerprinting

Code associated with the with the XXXXXXXXX publication.

# Information

Contains codes to i) perform fingerpritning analyses, ii) compute relative contribution of fingerpritning features (i.e., ICC analysis) iii) run regression and decoding analyses iv) plot results 

# Methods

Overvire of fingerpritning pipeline:

Code is organized in such a way that all the fingerpritning and ICC analyses are done within the pythin environment and saved to a csv

This is then used in R to run additional analyses (e.g., relate the spatial distribution of ICC features to maps obtained from the neuromaps toolbox).

See XXXXX for details.
